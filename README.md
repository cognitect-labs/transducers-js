# transducers-js

A high performance
[Transducers](http://blog.cognitect.com/blog/2014/8/6/transducers-are-coming)
implementation for JavaScript.

Transducers are composable algorithmic transformations. They are
independent from the context of their input and output sources and
specify only the essence of the transformation in terms of an
individual element. Because transducers are decoupled from input or
output sources, they can be used in many different processes -
collections, streams, channels, observables, etc. Transducers compose
directly, without awareness of input or creation of intermediate
aggregates.

## Releases and Dependency Information

* Latest release: 0.4.180

### JavaScript

You can include either the [release](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.180-min.js) (2K gzipped) or [development](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.180.js) build of transducers-js on your webpage. We also provide [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) compatible [release](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.180-amd-min.js) and [dev](http://cdn.cognitect.com/transducers/transducers-0.4.180-amd.js) builds.

### Node.js

transducers-js is released to [npm](https://www.npmjs.org). Add transducers-js to your `package.json` dependencies:

```javascript
{...
  "dependencies": {
    "transducers-js": "0.4.180"
  }
 ...}
```

### Bower

You can also include transducers-js in your `bower.json` dependencies:

```javascript
{...
  "dependencies": {
    "transducers-js": "0.4.180"
  }
 ...}
```

## Usage

### Requiring

To import the library under Node.js you can just use `require`:

```js
var t = require("transducers-js");
```

The browser release of the library simply exports a top level
`transducers` object:

```js
var t = transducers;
```

### Basic Usage

With <=ES5:

```js
var map    = t.map,
    filter = t.filter,
    comp   = t.comp,
    into   = t.into;

var inc = function(n) { return n + 1; };
var isEven = function(n) { return n % 2 == 0; };
var xf = comp(map(inc), filter(isEven));

console.log(into([], xf, [0,1,2,3,4])); // [2,4]
```

With ES6:

```js
let {map, filter, comp, into} = t;

let inc = (n) => n + 1;
let isEven = (n) => n % 2 == 0;
let xf = comp(map(inc), filter(isEven));

console.log(into([], xf, [0,1,2,3,4])); // [2,4]
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](http://cognitect-labs.github.io/transducers-js/classes/transducers.html)

## Integration

transducers-js can also easily be used in combination with *existing*
reduce implementations, whether native or the shims provided by
[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) and
[Lodash](http://lodash.com). Doing so with native and Underscore can
deliver significant performance benefits. transducers may be easily
converted from their object representation into the necessary
two-arity function via `toFn`.

```js
var arr   = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],
    apush = function(arr, x) { arr.push(x); return arr; },
    xf    = comp(map(inc), filter(isEven)),
    toFn  = t.toFn;

arr.reduce(toFn(xf, apush), []); // native
_(arr).reduce(toFn(xf, apush), []); // underscore or lodash
```

### Immutable-js

transducers-js can work with custom collection types and still
deliver the same performance benefits, for example with Immutable-js:

```js
var Immutable  = require("immutable"),
    t          = require("transducers-js"),
    comp       = t.comp,
    map        = t.map,
    filter     = t.filter,
    transduce  = t.transduce;

var inc = function(n) { return n + 1; };
var isEven = function(n) { return n % 2 == 0; };
var sum = function(a,b) { return a+b; };

var largeVector = Immutable.List();

for(var i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
    largeVector = largeVector.push(i);
}

// built in Immutable-js functionality
largeVector.map(inc).filter(isEven).reduce(sum);

// faster with transducers
var xf = comp(map(inc),filter(isEven));
transduce(xf, sum, 0, largeVector);
```

### ES6 Collections

ES6 collections return iterators and therefore can be
reduced/transduced. For example with
[transit-js](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-js) collections
which satisfy many of the proposed Map/Set methods:

```js
var transit = require("transit-js"),
    t       = require("transducers-js"),
    m       = transit.map(["foo", "bar", "baz", "woz"]),
    vUC     = function(kv) { return [kv[0], kv[1].toUpperCase()]; },
    xf      = t.map(vUC);
    madd    = function(m, kv) { m.set(kv[0], kv[1]); return m; };

transduce(xf, madd, transit.map(), m.entries()); // Map ["foo", "BAR", "baz", "WOZ"]
```

## The Transducer Protocol

It is a goal that all JavaScript transducer implementations
interoperate regardless of the surface level API. Towards this end the
following outlines the protocol all transducers must follow.

### Transducer composition

Transducers are simply a function of one arity. The only argument
is another transducer *transformer* (labeled `xf` in the code base).
Note the distinction between the *transducer* which is a function of
one argument and the *transformer* an object whose methods we'll
describe in the following section.

For example the following simplified definition of `map`:

```js
var map = function(f) {
    return function(xf) {
        return Map(f, xf);
    };
};
```

Since transducers are simply functions of one argument they can be
composed easily via function composition to create transformer
pipelines. Note that transducers return transformers when invoked.

### Transformer protocol

Transformers are objects. They must implement 3 methods, `@@transducer/init`,
`@@transducer/result` and `@@transducer/step`. If a transformer is intended to 
be composed with other transformers they should either close over the next 
transformer or store it in a field.

For example the `Map` transformer could look something like the
following:

```js
var Map = function(f, xf) {
    return {
       "@@transducer/init": function() { 
           return xf["@@transducer/init"](); 
       },
       "@@transducer/result": function(result) { 
           return xf["@@transducer/result"](result); 
       },
       "@@transducer/step": function(result, input) {
           return xf["@@transducer/step"](result, f(input)); 
       }
    };
};
```

Note how we take care to call the next transformer in the pipeline. We
could have of course created `Map` as a proper JavaScript type with
prototype methods - this is in fact how it is done in transducers-js.

### Reduced

Detecting the reduced state is critical to short circuiting a
reduction/transduction. A reduced value is denoted by any JavaScript
object that has the property `@@transducer/reduced` set to `true`.
The reduced value should be stored in the `@@transducer/value` property of this 
object.

### Iteration

Anything which implements `@@iterator` which returns an ES6 compliant
iterator is reducible/transducible. An ES6 iterator may also just be given directly to `reduce` or `transduce`.
